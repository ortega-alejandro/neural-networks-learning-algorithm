    "Training a low-bias learning algorithm on a massive dataset is one of the best ways to get a high performance machine learning system. However, learning with large datasets result in computational penalties, increasing in severity as the dimension of the data increases.\n",

    "Suppose a dataset consisted of $m=100000000$ samples, and a classification algorithm was being trained using the gradient descent rule:\n",

    "$$ \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\dfrac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m\\left(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\\right)x_j^{(i)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the learning rate and $h_\\theta$ is the hypothesis function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a summation over a hundred million samples must be computed to calculate the derivative term and perform a _single_ step of gradient descent. This summation results in severe computational expenses."
